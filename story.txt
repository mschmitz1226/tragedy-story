Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not it's
not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis the 
Wise was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise, he could use the 
Force to incluence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a
knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about
from dying.
