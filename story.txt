Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not it's
not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis the 
Wise was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise, he could use the 
Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a
knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about
from dying.

Darth Plagueis's teachings were passed down through the generations to great
sith lords such as Darth Maul and Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious taught his
pupil Darth Vader about how he, like Darth Plagueis, could stop his loved
ones from dying. But Anakin was totally soft and was unable to influence
enough midichlorians to stop Padme from dying (spoiler alert).
