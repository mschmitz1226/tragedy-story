Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not it's
not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis the 
Wise was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise, he could use the 
Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a
knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about
from dying.

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to
be unnatural.  He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was
losing his power... which, eventually of course, he did.  Unfortunately, 
he taught is apprentice everything he knew.  Then his apprentice killed him
in his sleep.  Ironic.  He could save others from death, but not himself.

Darth Plagueis's teachings were passed down through the generations to great
sith lords such as Darth Maul and Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious taught his
pupil Darth Vader about how he, like Darth Plagueis, could stop his loved
ones from dying. But Anakin was totally soft and was unable to influence
enough midichlorians to stop Padme from dying (spoiler alert).

So maybe the midichlorians was all a lie. Luke Skywalker certainly didn't
believe in them. But then, what did he know. He retreated to a deserted planet
soon after his victory over the Sith, setting the stage for an even worse
series of movies than the ones about his father.
